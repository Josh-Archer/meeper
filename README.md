## Features

- ü´ß Works seamlessly with your OpenAI account.

- üîê Your API Key is securely stored locally on your browser, encrypted, and never transmitted elsewhere.

- ü§ñ Meeper utilizes Whisper for accurate transcriptions and ChatGPT for generating summaries.

- üíø Speech detection feature optimizes API usage by activating only when speech sounds are detected, reducing up to 30% of resource consumption.

- üß© Utilizes the chrome tabCapture API to capture audio from specific tabs.

- üéÆ Multiple launch options available: hotkey activation, extension popup, and context menu integration.

- üïπÔ∏è Real-time control of transcription playback, similar to a music player.

- üéõÔ∏è Supports running transcriptions simultaneously from multiple tabs.

- üîÄ Choose between streaming or chunk-based transcription modes; streaming uses a WebSocket for continuous audio while chunk mode updates about once a second.

- üåé Multilingual support for diverse language requirements.

- üì† History is stored directly on the local machine.

## Usage

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install Meeper from the Chrome Web Store or your browser's extension marketplace.

2. Upon installation, enter your OpenAI API Key in the extension settings. Rest assured, the key is securely stored on your local machine and never shared externally.

3. Launch Meeper using one of the following methods:
  - Press the configured hotkey combination.
  - Click on the Meeper icon in the browser toolbar and select "Launch Meeper."
  - Right-click on a tab and choose the "Launch Meeper" option from the context menu.

4. Once Meeper is activated, it will start transcribing the audio from the currently selected tab. You can control the playback, pause, or skip to specific sections of the transcription in real-time.

5. Enjoy the convenience of having accurate transcriptions and summaries for your in-browser conferences!

### Local Summarization with Ollama

You can run Meeper locally for the summarization step using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

1. Install Ollama and start the daemon (follow instructions on the Ollama website).
1. Pull a model, e.g.

  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.1
  ```

1. Open Meeper Settings ‚Üí LLM Provider and switch from OpenAI to "Ollama (local)".
1. (Optional) Change the model name or base URL if you run Ollama on a different port or want another model (`mistral`, `qwen2`, etc.).
1. Generate a summary ‚Äî it will now use your local model.

### Fully Local Mode (Transcription + Summarization)

You can also remove the OpenAI API key dependency entirely by using a local, OpenAI-compatible Whisper server for transcription plus Ollama for summaries.

1. Follow the steps above to enable Ollama for summarization.
1. Run a local transcription server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

  - Must accept `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart/form-data) with fields `file`, `model`, optional `language`, `prompt`.
  - Examples: self-hosted Whisper (whisper.cpp server), LM Studio, or any proxy implementing the OpenAI audio API.

1. In Settings ‚Üí Transcription Provider choose "Custom (local)".
1. Enter Base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) and the transcription Model name your server expects.
1. Leave the OpenAI API key blank ‚Äî Meeper will skip key validation when both providers are local.
1. Record & summarize; everything stays on your machine.

Notes:
- Local models can be slower; start with short recordings.
- If a summary or transcription fails, confirm: (a) server is running, (b) model downloaded, (c) correct Base URL & model name.
- Custom transcription mode still sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>` only if a key was set; otherwise header is omitted.
